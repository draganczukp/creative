		<h2>How I make this blog</h2>

<h3>The blog script</h3>
<p>
I created a shell script that handles most of the things related to blogging, like creating a post and publishing it. It does not use a database (unless you count plain text files) and employs a lot of sed bullshitery to make it all work.
</p>
<p>
The whole script is available on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/draganczukp/blog">here</a>. Just set the variables to suit your needs
</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>Running the script by itself shows a menu with a few options, which can be passed as arguments instead.</p>
<p>The option "c" asks for a post title, then creates an empty draft and opens it in default editor, which for me is nvim. The draft is just a HTML file, but without the whole html skeleton (things like doctype, head or opening/closing body tags).</p>
<p>Once you're done writing the post, you are asked if you want the post to be marked for publishing. This just copies the draft to another
folder, which helps keep ready posts separate from posts that still need some work.</p>
<p>Posts can be later edited using option "u" (for update), which lists all posts to choose from with FZF.</p>
<p>You can also use "d" to permanently delete a post. It is currently not possible to unpublish a post once it has been published from the script. You have to delete it from "published" folder manually.</p>
<p>Once you have a couple of posts ready, you can render them with "r". This does three things:
<ul>
	<li>create finished .html files for each published post (like this one) by loading a template and replacing specific things with a post</li>
	<li>Create a list of links to all the rendered posts</li>
	<li>Create a big page with every single post one after another</li>
</ul>
I might also add RSS to the mix, but I don't know if anyone will use it.
</p>
<p>
The last step is deploying the blog with "u" (or running <code>./deploy</code> directly). For me it copies specific files to my VPS using scp, then runs a build script with ssh, but you can chage it to do whatever you want.
</p>
<p>
That's it. All you have to do is set your server to show your blog and you're done.

<h3>OMG you copied Luke Smith's lb!!!11!!1!one!oneone!</h3>
<p>
Yes, I did base my script on his. I saw what he did and I thought to myself: "I can do that too". So I did. Mine isn't as compact as his and depends on FZF, but it has some extra features, like being compatible with every web server, not just Apache.
</p>
<p>
Besides, I treat Luke as a mentor who taught me a lot of things, like Vim text objects, sed and Latex. I use a lot of snippets copy-pasted from his dotfiles into mine and they are great little things I would never have thought about
</p>
<p>
If Luke doesn't like the fact that I practically copied his script, he can contact me through multiple means. Github issues would be the simples way.
