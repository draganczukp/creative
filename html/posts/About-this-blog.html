<h3>Who are you?</h3>
<p>My name is Przemek Dragańczuk. I live in Poland and I'm currently studying IT at Uniwersytet Zielonogórski.</p>
<p>I always liked computers, so naturally I went to an IT technikum (a specialised High School where you actually learn how to do something useful) in my home city, where I discovered just how great Linux is.
After a year from when I first learned how to use it, I installed Ubuntu on my PC, but it was so slow I decided to use a different distro. I randomly chose Manjaro and accidentally downloaded the i3 edition. I instantly fell in love with it, since on Windows I was already using as many keyboard shortcuts as possible.</p>
<p>
A couple months later I got bored of Manjaro and how it holds your hand with everything, so I decided to try installing Arch. The first time I did it I broke pretty much everything I could have broken during installation. The second time went better, but it still wouldn't work. After about 5th attempt I had a working system with i3 installed.
</p>
<p>
During the installing I learnt a lot about how Linux works and I finally stopped being afraid of the command line and embraced the shell. Since then I learned Vim, then I switched to neovim and I didn't miss Windows and IDEs at all.
</p>
<p>
 Then I went to college and in order to make notes during lecture, a lot of which were Math, I learnt basic Latex.
</p>
<p>
If you're already bored, then I want to warn you, that I'm bad at writing and getting straight to the point, which in this case is: I'm trying to live as bloat free as possible, while not sacrificing anything I like.
</p>

<h3>What is this blog?</h3>

<p>
In this blog I'm talking about a lot of things, usually Linux and Linux software. I sometimes talk about programming or make tutorials on setting up some of the software I use. I'm not writing for little kids, so expect to see some swearing, especially when I'm complaining about something
</p>
<p>
This blog was written entirely in neovim on an Arch Linux PC (by the way I use Arch). It's also still work in progress, which is why some things don't look as good as they can, like the headings, which are too small or no visible border between posts and rest of the site.
</p>

<h3>What do I define is "bloat"?</h3>
<p>
My definition of bloat might be different from what others think, but it's really simple:
<ul>
	<li>Things that use more resources than they should, for example: all the electron apps, Google Chrome, Windows</li>
	<li>Things that have a fuck ton of features nobody asked for or needs. Just look at Instagram: What used to be a simple photo sharing app now has all these features, like stories or Instagram TV that 90% of users just ignore</li>
	<li>Anything that spies on its users, including Microsoft, Google, Facebook etc.</li>
	<li>All those websites that take 10 minutes to load because they have to download 100MB worth of frameworks and trackers before they can show you the content</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>What isn't bloat then?</h3>
<p>
	That big list might make you feel like there is no software I don't consider bloat, but that's not correct. There is a lot of software that no one would consider bloated, for example:
	<ul>
		<li>Linux: The kernel is huge and contains a lot of stuff most people don't use, but it's relatively easy to compile your own kernel without all that stuff. Even if you leave them, about 40MB for all the drivers I would ever need and a lot of other useful things is not that much</li>
		<li>(neo)Vim and CLI apps in general are fast, small and almost all the features are useful, even if not everyone knows about them</li>
		<li>Hundreds or thousands of apps that do just what they're supposed to do, like Mozilla Firefox, Geary, the entire Unix tool suite etc.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>Bloat that I can't cut out of my life</h3>
<p>
Despite my hatred towards bloat, I still use a lot of bloated software. I use:
<ul>
	<li>gmail - only because I don't have the time to set up an email server on my VPS</li>
	<li>Windows - A lot of software I have to use in college (like 3DSMax) works only on Windows. Also, Linux is still not the perfect platform for gaming, at least not yet</li>
	<li>Facebook and messenger - Simply for communication with my classmates. If you say that we should use something else, you try to tell about 30 student that they should stop using the communicator they used for years and they use to talk with almost everyone and use something maybe one of them heard about before. I'll wait here and laugh at you with them</li>
	<li>Spotify - I haven't found any other way to listen to music everywhere without problems that's just as cheap and, what's more important, legal</li>
</ul>
